Flask Hangman (text-based game in a web UI)

This Flask application implements a simple Hangman game using a predefined
word list. It demonstrates:
- How to start and manage a game session (using Flask sessions).
- How to validate and process letter guesses.
- How to render the game's state (ASCII hangman, revealed letters).
- Step-by-step comments explain each part of the flow.

How it works:
1. User visits the home page (/), selects a difficulty level, and clicks "Start Game".
2. /start initializes a new game and stores the state in `session`.
3. /game shows the current game state and a form to submit a letter guess.
4. /guess processes the submitted letter, updates the session state, and
   redirects back to /game to show the updated state.
5. The game ends when the user guesses all letters (win) or uses up the
   allowed wrong attempts (loss). A Play Again button lets the user restart.

To run:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. export FLASK_APP=app.py    # or set FLASK_APP on Windows
3. flask run
4. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000

Author: Example with detailed comments for learning and extension.
